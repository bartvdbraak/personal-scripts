# Personal Scripts
Scripts that I wrote (mostly bash) for personal use and automation. Most of them were written on Linux Mint Tina, so they might need some dependencies on other systems.

### firefox-update.sh
A script that updates your firefox install. Needs some fixes.

### switch-automate.sh
Changes `alsamixer`'s setting for Auto-Mute, such that you can switch inputs that are on your line-out audio (headphones/speakers).
